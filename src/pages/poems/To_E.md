The door was opened and I saw you there  
And for the first time heard you speak my name.  
Then like the sun your sweetness overcame  
My shy and shadowy mood; I was aware  
That joy was hidden in your happy hair,  
And that for you love held no hint of shame;  
My eyes caught light from yours, within whose flame  
Humor and passion have an equal share.

How many times since then have I not seen  
Your great eyes widen when you talk of love,  
And darken slowly with a fair desire;  
How many time since then your soul has been  
Clear to my gaze as curving skies above,  
Wearing like them a raiment made of fire.

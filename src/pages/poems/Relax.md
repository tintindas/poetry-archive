Bad things are going to happen.  
Your tomatoes will grow a fungus  
and your cat will get run over.  
Someone will leave the bag with the ice cream  
melting in the car and throw  
your blue cashmere sweater in the drier.  
Your husband will sleep  
with a girl your daughter’s age, her breasts spilling  
out of her blouse. Or your wife  
will remember she’s a lesbian  
and leave you for the woman next door. The other cat–  
the one you never really liked–will contract a disease  
that requires you to pry open its feverish mouth  
every four hours. Your parents will die.  
No matter how many vitamins you take,  
how much Pilates, you’ll lose your keys,  
your hair and your memory. If your daughter  
doesn’t plug her heart  
into every live socket she passes,  
you’ll come home to find your son has emptied  
the refrigerator, dragged it to the curb,  
and called the used appliance store for a pick up–drug money.  
There’s a Buddhist story of a woman chased by a tiger.  
When she comes to a cliff, she sees a sturdy vine  
and climbs half way down. But there’s also a tiger below.  
And two mice–one white, one black–scurry out  
and begin to gnaw at the vine. At this point  
she notices a wild strawberry growing from a crevice.  
She looks up, down, at the mice.  
Then she eats the strawberry.  
So here’s the view, the breeze, the pulse  
in your throat. Your wallet will be stolen, you’ll get fat,  
slip on the bathroom tiles of a foreign hotel  
and crack your hip. You’ll be lonely.  
Oh taste how sweet and tart  
the red juice is, how the tiny seeds  
crunch between your teeth.

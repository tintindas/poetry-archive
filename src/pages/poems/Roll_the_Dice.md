if you’re going to try, go all the  
way.  
otherwise, don’t even start.

if you’re going to try, go all the  
way.  
this could mean losing girlfriends,  
wives, relatives, jobs and  
maybe your mind.

go all the way.  
it could mean not eating for 3 or 4 days.  
it could mean freezing on a  
park bench.  
it could mean jail,  
it could mean derision,  
mockery,  
isolation.  
isolation is the gift,  
all the others are a test of your  
endurance, of  
how much you really want to  
do it.  
and you’ll do it  
despite rejection and the worst odds  
and it will be better than  
anything else  
you can imagine.

if you’re going to try,  
go all the way.  
there is no other feeling like  
that.  
you will be alone with the gods  
and the nights will flame with  
fire.

do it, do it, do it.  
do it.

all the way  
all the way.

you will ride life straight to  
perfect laughter, its  
the only good fight  
there is.

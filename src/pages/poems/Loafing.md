I looked into the room a moment ago,  
and this is what I sawâ€”  
my chair in its place by the window,  
the book turned facedown on the table.  
And on the sill, the cigarette  
left burning in its ashtray.  
Malingerer! my uncle yelled at me  
so long ago. He was right.  
I've set aside time today,  
same as every day,  
for doing nothing at all.

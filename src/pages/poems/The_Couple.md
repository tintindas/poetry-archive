# The Couple  
  
### Louis Jenkins  
  
They no longer sleep quite as well as they did  
when they were younger. He lies awake thinking  
of things that happened years ago, turning  
uncomfortably from time to time, pulling on the  
blankets. She worries about money. First one  
and then the other is awake during the night,  
in shifts as if keeping watch, though they can’t  
see very much in the dark and it’s quiet. They  
are sentries at some outpost, an abandoned fort  
somewhere in the middle of the Great Plains  
where only the wind is a regular visitor. Each  
stands guard in the wilderness of an imagined  
life in which the other sleeps untroubled.

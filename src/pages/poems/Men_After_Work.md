title: Men After Work
poet: Dana Gioia

Done with work, they are sitting by themselves  
in coffeeshops or diners, taking up the booths,  
filling every other seat along the counter,  
waiting for the menu, for the water,  
for the girl to come and take their order,  
always on the edge of words, almost without appetite,  
knowing there is nothing on the menu that they want,  
waiting patiently to ask for one  
more refill of their coffee, surprised  
that even its bitterness will not wake them up.  
Still they savor it, holding each sip  
lukewarm in their mouths, this last taste of evening.

For me, the pleasure of poetry  
is taking it apart.  
—Jeanne-Andree Nelson

Jeanne, I have spent days arranging  
this bowl of fruit, all for you,  
knowing how much you love fruit  
(not to eat, of course, but to examine),  
and I’ve been careful to make sure  
the bananas are the shape of bananas,  
that the oranges rhyme with oranges,  
and for your pleasure I’ve included  
a lone pear, which may signify  
something to you I haven’t intended,  
which is my intention.  
No doubt you’ve begun to question  
why the quince and the apple  
are so close together, and (knowing you)  
if there might be a worm  
in the apple, whether this gift  
is a gift at all. And perhaps it’s true  
that I’ve covered up the worm hole  
with putty, painted over it perfectly,  
though this would be a mystery  
that only can be solved  
by cutting open or biting into,  
letting the juices run down the sides  
of your mouth, or onto your hands.  
It would be the kind of bold probing  
I would love for you to love, the final  
messiness of theory, still-life breaking open  
into life, the discovery that the secret worm,  
if real, will not permit you any distance.  
But surely by now you’ve come to realize  
there is no worm, only this bowl of fruit  
made out of words, only these seductions.

title: what they did yesterday afternoon
poet: warsan shire
---

they set my aunt’s house on fire  
i cried the way women on tv do  
folding at the middle  
like a five pound note.  
i called the boy who use to love me  
tried to ‘okay’ my voice  
i said hello  
he said warsan, what’s wrong, what’s happened?

i’ve been praying,  
and these are what my prayers look like;  
dear god  
i come from two countries  
one is thirsty  
the other is on fire  
both need water.

later that night  
i held an atlas in my lap  
ran my fingers across the whole world  
and whispered  
where does it hurt?

it answered  
everywhere  
everywhere  
Everywhere.

# On the Origins of Things  
  
### Troy Jollimore  
  
Everyone knows that the moon started out  
as a renegade fragment of the sun, a solar  
flare that fled that hellish furnace  
and congealed into a flat frozen pond suspended  
between the planets. But did you know  
that anger began as music, played  
too often and too loudly by drunken musicians  
at weddings and garden parties? Or that turtles  
evolved from knuckles, ice from tears, and darkness  
from misunderstanding? As for the dominant  
thesis regarding the origin of love, I  
abstain from comment, nor will I allow  
myself to address the idea that dance  
began as a kiss, that happiness was  
an accidental import from Spain, that the ancient  
game of jump-the-fire gave rise  
to politics. But I will confess  
/that I began as an astronomer—a liking  
for bright flashes, vast distances, unreachable  
things, a hand stretched always toward  
the furthest limit—and that my longing  
for you has never taken me far  
from that original desire, to inscribe  
a comet's orbit around the walls  
of our city, to gently stroke the surface of the stars.

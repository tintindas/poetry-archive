# Vigil  
  
### Dennis O'Driscoll  
  
Life is too short to sleep through.  
Stay up late, wait until the sea of traffic ebbs,  
until noise has drained from the world  
like blood from the cheeks of the full moon.  
Everyone else around you has succumbed:  
they lie like tranquillised pets on a vet's table;  
they languish on hospital trolleys and friends' couches,  
on iron beds in hostels for the homeless,  
under feather duvets at tourist B&Bs.  
The radio, devoid of listeners to confide in,  
turns repetitious. You are your own voice-over.  
You are alone in the bone-weary tower  
of your bleary-eyed, blinking lighthouse,  
watching the spillage of tide on the shingle inlet.  
You are the single-minded one who hears  
time shaking from the clock's fingertips  
like drops, who watches its hands  
chop years into diced seconds,  
who knows that when the church bell  
tolls at 2 or 3 it tolls unmistakably for you.  
You are the sole hand on deck when  
temperatures plummet and the hull  
of an iceberg is jostling for prominence.  
Your confidential number is the life-line  
where the sedated long-distance voices  
of despair hold out muzzily for an answer.  
You are the emergency services' driver  
ready to dive into action at the first  
warning signs of birth or death.  
You spot the crack in night's fa√ßade  
even before the red-eyed businessman  
on look-out from his transatlantic seat.  
You are the only reliable witness to when  
the light is separated from the darkness,  
who has learned to see the dark in its true  
colours, who has not squandered your life.

# Night Walk  
  
### Franz Wright  
  
The all-night convenience store's empty  
and no one is behind the counter.  
You open and shut the glass door a few times  
causing a bell to go off,  
but no one appears. You only came  
to buy a pack of cigarettes, maybe  
a copy of yesterday's newspaperâ€”  
finally you take one and leave  
thirty-five cents in its place.  
It is freezing, but it is a good thing  
to step outside again:  
you can feel less alone in the night,  
with lights on here and there  
between the dark buildings and trees.  
Your own among them, somewhere.  
There must be thousands of people  
in this city who are dying  
to welcome you into their small bolted rooms,  
to sit you down and tell you  
what has happened to their lives.  
And the night smells like snow.  
Walking home, for a moment  
you almost believe you could start again.  
And an intense love rushes to your heart,  
and hope. It's unendurable, unendurable.

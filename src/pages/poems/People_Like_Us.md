title: People Like Us

There are more like us. All over the world  
There are confused people, who can’t remember  
The name of their dog when they wake up, and people  
Who love God but can’t remember where

He was when they went to sleep. It’s  
All right. The world cleanses itself this way.  
A wrong number occurs to you in the middle  
Of the night, you dial it, it rings just in time

To save the house. And the second-story man  
Gets the wrong address, where the insomniac lives,  
And he’s lonely, and they talk, and the thief  
Goes back to college. Even in graduate school,

You can wander into the wrong classroom,  
And hear great poems lovingly spoken  
By the wrong professor. And you find your soul,  
And greatness has a defender, and even in death you’re safe.

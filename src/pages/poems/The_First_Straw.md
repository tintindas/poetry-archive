I used to think love was two people sucking  
on the same straw to see whose thirst was stronger,

but then I whiffed the crushed walnuts of your nape,  
traced jackals in the snow-covered tombstones of your teeth.

I used to think love was a non-stop saxophone solo  
in the lungs, till I hung with you like a pair of sneakers

from a phone line, and you promised to always smell  
the rose in my kerosene. I used to think love was terminal

pelvic ballet, till you let me jog beside while you pedaled  
all over hell on the menstrual bicycle, your tongue

ripping through my prairie like a tornado of paper cuts.  
I used to think love was an old man smashing a mirror

over his knee, till you helped me carry the barbell  
of my spirit back up the stairs after my car pirouetted

in the desert. You are my history book. I used to not believe  
in fairy tales till I played the dunce in sheep’s clothing

and felt how perfectly your foot fit in the glass slipper  
of my ass. But then duty wrapped its phone cord

around my ankle and yanked me across the continent.  
And now there are three thousand miles between the u

and s in esophagus. And being without you is like standing  
at a cement-filled wall with a roll of Yugoslavian nickels

and making a wish. Some days I miss you so much  
I’d jump off the roof of your office building

just to catch a glimpse of you on the way down. I wish  
we could trade left eyeballs, so we could always see

what the other sees. But you’re here, I’m there,  
and we have only words, a nightly phone call - one chance

to mix feelings into syllables and pour into the receiver,  
hope they don’t disassemble in that calculus of wire.

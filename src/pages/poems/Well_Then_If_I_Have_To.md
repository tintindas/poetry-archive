# Well Then If I Have To  
  
### J.R.Solonche  
  
sit here for all this time  
and do nothing except look out  
the window at the rain,  
that is what I’ll do.  
I will not go mad.  
I will not gain wisdom.  
But when I’m done,  
I will know more about sitting,  
and I will know more about looking,  
and I will know more about rain.

title: Not Anyone Who Says
poet: Mary Oliver

Not anyone who says, “I’m going to be  
careful and smart in matters of love,”  
who says, “I’m going to choose slowly,”  
but only those lovers who didn’t choose at all  
but were, as it were, chosen  
by something invisible and powerful and uncontrollable  
and beautiful and possibly even  
unsuitable —  
only those know what I’m talking about  
in this talking about love.

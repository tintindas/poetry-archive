title: Love in the Dark Country
poet: Kapka Kassabova

Tomorrow for twenty-four hours  
I’ll be in the same country as you.

The sky will be constantly shifting,  
the morning will be green, a single morning  
for my single bed. And in the night

as the dark country goes to sleep  
a church bell will measure  
the jet-lag of my heart.

I’ll open my suitcase and unfold my life  
like a blanket. In the dark country I will lie  
all night and wonder how this came to be:

the one light left in the world  
is your window, somewhere in the land

of thin rain and expensive trains.  
And instead of maps, I have an onward ticket.

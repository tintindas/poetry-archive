# A Drink of Water  
  
### Jeffrey Harrison  
  
When my nineteen-year-old son turns on the kitchen tap  
and leans down over the sink and tilts his head sideways  
to drink directly from the stream of cool water,  
I think of my older brother, now almost ten years gone,  
who used to do the same thing at that age;  
  
and when he lifts his head back up and, satisfied,  
wipes the water dripping from his cheek  
with his shirtsleeve, it’s the same casual gesture  
my brother used to make; and I don’t tell him  
to use a glass, the way our father told my brother,  
  
because I like remembering my brother  
when he was young, decades before anything  
went wrong, and I like the way my son  
becomes a little more my brother for a moment  
through this small habit born of a simple need,  
  
which, natural and unprompted, ties them together  
across the bounds of death, and across time …  
as if the clear stream flowed between two worlds  
and entered this one through the kitchen faucet,  
my son and brother drinking the same water.

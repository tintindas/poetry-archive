# Today My Alarm Went Off At 12:30PM  
  
### Mira Gonzalez  
  
I stayed in bed for over an hour  
looked at things on my phone  
I felt slightly anxious about nothing particular  
I walked downstairs and poured coffee into a jar  
I asked a person on the internet if I should take drugs  
I took drugs before the person had time to respond  
  
I feel alienated by people who express concern about me without  
defining their concern in terms of a specific solution or goal  
I dont feel comforted by the idea of an afterlife  
I dont want to continue experiencing things after I die  
I want someone to pull my hair because I like the idea of someone  
controlling my head without touching my head  
  
what is the difference between being an independent person  
and being a person who is accepting of loneliness

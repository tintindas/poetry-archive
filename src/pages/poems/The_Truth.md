These are the facts:  
Cigarettes will kill you.  
Yes does not always mean yes.  
How kind you are to people  
sometimes does not matter.  
Coffee is bad for you.  
8 hours of sleep should not be a goal;  
it should always be a reality.  
Green vegetables will keep you  
young for as long as you eat them.  
Nothing will ever be as beautiful  
as your solitude.  
Breathing deeply can calm you down  
in any situation.  
Mediation will center you  
but only for a short time.  
Love will hold you together  
when you are falling apart.

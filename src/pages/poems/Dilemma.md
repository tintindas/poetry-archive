# Dilemma  
  
### Leigh Anne Hornfeldt  
  
If I tell my son his mouse is dying  
I may as well tell him the rest:  
her shallow breath means her lungs are deflating,  
causing the rest of her organs to slowly betray  
her. If he asks me if it’s painful, well.  
What can hide him  
from that truth? Her cage  
is littered with her loss of strength:  
untouched water bottle, food pellets  
staling in the pink plastic bowl.  
  
If I tell him she’s dying I may as well tell him  
the worst of it, that his father and I  
knew exactly what we were doing  
when we encouraged him to choose her,  
the fastest mouse of the dozens  
of albinos in the pet store’s glass aquarium, yes,  
we brought her home to die and hoped  
that in his grief he might learn the hard fact  
of life. We named it mercy. We named it introduction.  
Better now than let sorrow catch him later.  
And if I tell him that I may as well tell him  
I was wrong. What was I thinking. As if  
arming him with this one little death  
were protection enough.

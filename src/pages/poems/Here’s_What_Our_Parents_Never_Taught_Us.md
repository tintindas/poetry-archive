# Here’s What Our Parents Never Taught Us  
  
### Shinji Moon  
  
Here’s what our parents never taught us:  
  
You will stay up on your rooftop until sunlight peels away the husk of the moon,  
chainsmoking cigarettes and reading Baudelaire, and  
you will learn that you only ever want to fall in love with someone  
who will stay up to watch the sun rise with you.  
  
You will fall in love with train rides, and sooner or later you will  
realize that nowhere seems like home anymore.  
  
A woman will kiss you and you’ll think her lips are two petals  
rubbing against your mouth.  
  
You will not tell anyone that you liked it.  
It’s okay.  
It is beautiful to love humans in a world where love is a metaphor for lust.  
  
You can leave if you want, with only your skin as a carry-on.  
  
All you need is a twenty in your pocket and a bus ticket.  
All you need is someone on the other end of the map, thinking about the supple  
curves of your body, to guide you to a home that stretches out for miles  
and miles on end.  
  
You will lie to everyone you love.  
They will love you anyways.  
  
One day you’ll wake up and realize that you are too big for your own skin.  
  
Molt.  
Don’t be afraid.

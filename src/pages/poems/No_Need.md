# No Need  
  
### Alain Bosquet  
  
The elephant's trunk  
is for picking up pistachios:  
no need to bend over.  
The giraffe's neck  
is for grazing on stars:  
no need to fly.  
The chameleon's skin,  
green, blue, lavender, white,  
as it wishes,  
is for hiding from ravenous animals:  
no need to flee.  
The turtle's shell,  
is for sleeping inside,  
even in winter:  
no need for a house.  
The poet's poem,  
is for saying all of that  
and a thousand thousand thousand other things:  
no need to understand.
